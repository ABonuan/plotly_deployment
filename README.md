# Bellybutton Biodiversity
A dashboard for bacterial data of volunteers who gave samples of their belly button bacteria.

## Purpose
A biological researcher, who works at a prominent microbiology lab, discovers & documents bacterial species that are not well studied.  The lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food start-up company. Their aim is to research candidate species, and to discover the bacterial species that have ability to syntesize protein that tastes like beef.  The biological researcher hypothesizes that microorganisms found in the bellybuttons of humans may provide the next best taste, and closests taste to beef.

Samples of navels from a number of people across the country were taken to identify the bacterial species that colonize our bellybuttons.  The volunteers are identified only by an ID number, which is associated with demographic & bacterial data information.  The Dashboard allows the volunteers to access their information and find out if the microorganisms from their navel are promising for Improbable Beef's initiative.
